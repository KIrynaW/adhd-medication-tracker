# Welcome to ADHD Medication Tracker
This project is a terminal-based Python application that supports users diagnosed with ADHD, in their medication intake and adjustment journey. It allows the user to make logs for every day; creating a history database of dosage changes, marks dose intake, efficacy, presence of side effects and their own observation. Additionaly the application calculates missed doses, amount of days with side effects, and tracks the efficacy of the medication over time.
This application is not only useful to those with ADHD, but also their caregivers, psychologist and psychiatrists that would aid in medication type and dose adjustment in ecery individual case.
